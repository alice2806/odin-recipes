        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tortellini</li>
            <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Baby spinach and Italian Parsley</li>
            <li>Red onion</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, cook the tortellini according to the package directions. Then drain well and cool in a very large bowl in the fridge.</li>
            <li>While the tortellini is cooking, slice the summer squash and the zucchini into 1/4-inch rounds and then quarter the rounds. Add them to a large bowl and sprinkle with salt and mix.</li>
            <li>Slice the cherry tomatoes in half. Slice the red onion in 1/4 inch half moons and soak it in cold water to dull its sharp flavor. Chop the parsley, and if the baby spinach leaves are large, chop them as well.</li>
            <li>Next, top the salad with chopped Italian parsley and Parmesan cheese. Then drizzle with the final 1/4 cup of Italian dressing. </li>
        </ol>
